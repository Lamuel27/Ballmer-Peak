WARNING!: This application will not work on a regular browser because Cross-Origin is not allowed.  We have tried everything to allow Cross-Origin, but nothing has worked for the Face ++ API. To see Face ++ work, go to your chrome editor and you should see the call in your network tab.
If you would like to risk it, get rid of your browser's security settings temporarily and it will work great! 

Here is a video showing a demo of our application!
