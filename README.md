Could you be related to a super hero? 

Upload your photo to compare to an array of super hero photos.  

The application will return the match with the highest probability, along with a brief description of the hero.

WARNING!: This application will not work on a regular browser because Cross-Origin is not allowed.  We have tried everything to allow Cross-Origin, but nothing has worked for the Face ++ API. To see Face ++ work, go to your chrome editor and you should see the call in your network tab.
If you would like to risk it, get rid of your browser's security settings temporarily and it will work great! 

Here is a video showing a demo of our application!
